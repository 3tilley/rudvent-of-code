1. Working with generic numbers
2. Slow intellisense
3. Adding and subtracting from usize
4. Randomly adding * and & to please the compiler
5. Different stages of the compiler are annoying. Borrow checks are always at the end
6. Type inference on .split and .lines is weird
7. Returning iterators is very painful from branches
